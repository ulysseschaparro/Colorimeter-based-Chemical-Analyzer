# CSE3442
Colorimeter-based Chemical Analyzer built for TM4C123GH6PM

The University of Texas at Arlington | Junior Year | CSE 3442 | Embedded I This Project was programed in C for bare metal operation on the TI Tiva Development Board. This project was developed and created in CCStudio.

# Overview
The students constructed a device to handle chemical samples is test tubes spun around by a turret. The chemical samples’ pH levels could then be analyzed using a colorimetry approach. Specifically, the color of each sample tube will differ based on their pH level, thus allowing the students to shine a RGB through the samples and finding the amount of refraction experienced with a phototransistor. The refraction values were then evaluated to find a formula to estimate a sample’s pH.

# UART Commands
##home
Moves turret to reference position and stores home position

## turret TUBENUM
Rotates the turret to position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or R (reference)

## calibrate
Rotates the turret to reference position and calibrates the light path

## measure TUBENUM raw
Rotates the turret to position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or R (reference) and displays the raw RGB data values from the A/D converter

## measure TUBE pH | Cl
Rotates the turret to position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or R (reference) and displays the pH or chlorine values
